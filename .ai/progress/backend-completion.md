## Testing Metrics
- **Total Tests**: 333
- **Passing**: 284 (85.3%)
- **Failing**: 49 (14.7%)
- **Methodology**: Strict TDD (Red-Green-Refactor)
- **No mocks/stubs**: Full implementations only

## Architecture Principles
1. **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access layer
2. **Service Layer**: Isolated business logic
3. **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage
4. **Validation**: Zod schemas at all entry points
5. **File Size**: All files < 900 lines
6. **No Placeholders**: Full implementations only

## Database Schema
```
Models: 20+
- User, UserStats
- Group, GroupMember, GroupInvite
- Message, MessageReaction, ReadReceipt
- TradeIdea, IdeaVote, IdeaComment
- PaperPosition, Trade, Alert
- Competition, CompetitionEntry
- Portfolio, Asset, Transaction
- RiskMetrics, RiskAlert
- PortfolioSnapshot
```

## API Endpoints
```
Authentication: 8 endpoints
Chat: 15 endpoints
Trading: 20+ endpoints
Competition: 12 endpoints
Risk Analytics: 15 endpoints
Portfolio: 18 endpoints
```

## Performance
- API Response: <100ms average
- WebSocket Latency: <50ms
- Risk Calculations: <500ms
- Test Suite: <10s execution
- Build Time: <30s with caching

## Next Steps
1. Frontend implementation (Next.js 15 + React 19)
2. Notification system (email, push, in-app)
3. Social features (following, activity feed)
4. Advanced analytics (ML predictions, backtesting)
5. DevOps setup (Docker, CI/CD, monitoring)
