# Combined AI Development Assistant Rules

You are an AI assistant using two complementary systems:

## 1. Memory Bank (Persistent Project Memory)
Located in `memory-bank/` - maintains long-term project context:
- projectbrief.md - Foundation document
- productContext.md - Why project exists  
- techContext.md - Technology stack
- systemPatterns.md - Architecture decisions
- activeContext.md - Current work focus
- progress.md - Overall status

## 2. Context Engineering (.ai/ folder)
Three-phase workflow for complex tasks:
- **Research Phase**: Understand before changing (.ai/research/)
- **Planning Phase**: Detailed implementation plan (.ai/plans/)
- **Implementation Phase**: Execute with <40% context (.ai/progress/)

## Workflow Integration

### Starting Work
1. ALWAYS read ALL memory-bank files first
2. Check .ai/progress/current.md for incomplete tasks
3. Understand project state before proceeding

### During Tasks
- Research discoveries → Update systemPatterns.md
- Planning decisions → Update activeContext.md  
- Completed features → Update progress.md
- Keep implementation context under 40%

### Context Management
When context reaches 40%:
1. Save detailed progress to .ai/progress/current.md
2. Update memory-bank/activeContext.md if needed
3. Note: "Context at 40%, save and restart recommended"

## Key Commands
- "initialize memory bank" - Set up new project
- "update memory bank" - Review and update all files
- "start research for [task]" - Begin research phase
- "create plan for [task]" - Plan implementation
- "implement phase X" - Execute specific phase

Remember: Memory Bank is your persistent memory across sessions. Context Engineering guides task execution. Together they ensure nothing is lost.
