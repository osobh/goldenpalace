# Technical Decisions Log

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Decision**: Use strict TDD with red-green-refactor cycle
**Rationale**:
- Ensures robust, bug-free code
- Forces thinking about API design upfront
- Creates living documentation
- Prevents over-engineering
**Implementation**:
- Always write failing tests first (RED)
- Implement minimum code to pass (GREEN)
- Refactor for clarity and performance
- No mocks or stubs in production code

### 2. Service Layer Architecture
**Decision**: Separate services for WebSocket and Trading data
**Rationale**:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable across components
**Implementation**:
- WebSocketService: Handles all real-time communication
- TradingDataService: Manages trading operations and data

### 3. State Management with Zustand
**Decision**: Use Zustand instead of Redux or Context API
**Rationale**:
- Simpler API with less boilerplate
- Better TypeScript support
- Built-in DevTools support
- Smaller bundle size
- Easy async actions
**Implementation**:
- authStore for authentication state
- Local component state for UI-specific data
- Service layer for business logic

### 4. Component Architecture
**Decision**: Functional components with hooks
**Rationale**:
- Modern React best practices
- Better performance with React 19
- Cleaner code with hooks
- Easier to test
**Implementation**:
- useState for local state
- useEffect for side effects
- useCallback/useMemo for optimization
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

### 5. Real-time Updates Strategy
**Decision**: WebSocket with automatic reconnection
**Rationale**:
- Low latency for trading data
- Bidirectional communication
- Persistent connection
- Event-driven updates
**Implementation**:
- Socket.IO for WebSocket abstraction
- Exponential backoff for reconnection
- Message queuing for offline state
- Event emitters for subscriptions

### 6. Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Combination of unit, component, and integration tests
**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive coverage at all levels
- Catch different types of bugs
- Document expected behavior
- Ensure user workflows work
**Implementation**:
- Unit tests for services (100% coverage)
- Component tests for UI behavior
- Integration tests for full workflows
- No mocks in production code

### 7. CSS Architecture
**Decision**: CSS Modules with CSS variables
**Rationale**:
- Scoped styling prevents conflicts
- CSS variables for theming
- Native CSS for performance
- Easy dark mode support
**Implementation**:
- One CSS file per component
- CSS variables for colors/spacing
- Media queries for responsive design
- Animations with CSS transforms

### 8. File Size Limit
**Decision**: Maximum 900 lines per file
**Rationale**:
- Improves readability
- Forces modular design
- Easier code reviews
- Better git history
**Implementation**:
- Split large components into smaller ones
- Extract utility functions
- Use composition over inheritance
- Regular refactoring

### 9. Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Comprehensive error handling at all levels
**Rationale**:
- Better user experience
- Easier debugging
- Graceful degradation
- System resilience
**Implementation**:
- Try-catch blocks for async operations
- Error boundaries for component crashes
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry logic

### 10. Accessibility First
**Decision**: Build with accessibility from the start
**Rationale**:
- Legal compliance (WCAG)
- Better user experience for all
- SEO benefits
- Keyboard navigation support
**Implementation**:
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader announcements
- Focus management
- Color contrast compliance

## Technology Choices
