# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Most retail traders fail because they lack proper education, community support, and a safe environment to practice. Traditional trading education is expensive, isolated, and often theoretical. Social trading platforms focus on copy-trading rather than learning. There's a gap for a collaborative platform where traders can learn together, share knowledge, and practice in a gamified environment without financial risk.
